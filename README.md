# fdf

This project is the first graphical project and is about representing a landscape as a 3D object
in which all surfaces are outlined in lines (wireframe model) by unsing the 42 school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create imagesand deal with keyboard and mouse events.
